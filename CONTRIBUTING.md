# Contributing

In is anticipated that primarily [TAU Commander] developers will be contributing to this repository, although bug fixes from users are more than welcome.

The default workflow is described on the main repository [README.md] page.
To summarize, a new branch should be created in a [fork] for external contributors or simply a new topic branch for [TAU Commander] developers.
Then a [pull request] against master should be opened.
Once the [CI Tests] have passed (or commits made and pushed to resolve any issues) the PR is merged into master.
Finally a [TAU Commander] developer can tag a new release at which point all of the binary distributions are included in a new release.
